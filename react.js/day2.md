# Component Lifecycle and Forms in Functional Components

* Ths `useEffect` hook allows you to handle side effects like data fetching, API calls, or subscriptions in functional components.

* It runs after the component renders and can clean up side effects when the component unmounts or re-renders.

# Conditional Rendering

* Conditional rendering allows us to show or hide components dynamically based on certain conditions, like state or props.

* Lists can be rendered efficiently using map() in Reactg, and each time in the list should  have aunique key prop for better performance.
