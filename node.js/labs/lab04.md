## Lab - Simple HTTP server and act as a client to make requests

### Objective
Build a simple HTTP server and act as a client to make requests.

### Steps:

#### Task 1: Create a simple HTTP client using http.request to fetch data from an API of your choice (e.g., jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
```
Goal: Print the API response to the console.  
Hint: Use GET method and specify the correct path.  
```

#### Task 2: Create an HTTP server using http.createServer.
```
Goal: Serve responses for different routes:  
/home should display "Welcome to the Home Page".  
/about should display "This is the About Page".  
Any other path should display "Hello, World!".  
```
#### Task 3: Test both the server and client functionality:
```
Server: Run the server and access the routes via a browser.  
Client: Run the client to see API data printed to the console.  
```
