## Lab - File System
### Objective
Write a script that reads all files and directories in the current folder and displays each file's status (whether it's a file or directory).

### Steps
#### 1. Create a script called listFiles.js.  
Use `fs.readdir` to read the contents of the current directory and fs.stat to determine whether each item is a file or a directory.

#### 2. Check the file type:
For each item, log whether it is a file or a directory using fs.stat. Implement this with either callbacks, promises, or async/await.

#### 3. Bonus:
If you've already used callbacks, try rewriting the code with fs.promises and async/await for a cleaner and more modern approach.
