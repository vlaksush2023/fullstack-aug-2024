# Background Image and Related Properties

## Objective:
Apply background images and experiment with background properties.


## Steps:

1. Create an HTML file lab5.html

2. Add a background image to the entire page using `background-image`. 

3. Use `background-repeat: no-repeat` to prevent the image from repeating.  

4. Set the `background-size: cover` to make the image cover the whole background.  

5. Use `background-position` to position the image at the center of the page.

## Expected Output:

1. The page should display a background image that covers the entire page, does not repeat, and is centered.
