# Lab Exercise: Advanced Selectors

## Objective:
Create an HTML page and apply styles using **advanced selectors** such as descendant, child, adjacent sibling, and general sibling selectors. Style elements using only `color` and `background-color` properties.

## Instructions:
1. Create an `advanced.html` file.
2. Use the **descendant selector** to change the color of all paragraphs (`<p>`) that are inside a `<div>` to red.
3. Use the **child selector** to set the background color of paragraphs that are direct children of a `<section>` element to light blue.
4. Use the **adjacent sibling selector** to change the background color of a paragraph that directly follows an `<h2>` heading to light gray.
5. Use the **general sibling selector** to set the background color of all paragraphs that are siblings of an `<h2>` to light pink.

## Example:
- Descendant paragraphs inside a `<div>` are red.
- Child paragraphs inside a `<section>` are light blue.
- The first paragraph after an `<h2>` is light gray.
- All sibling paragraphs of an `<h2>` are light pink.

## Expected Output:
- The page should reflect the use of advanced selectors to apply different colors and background colors based on the elementâ€™s relationship in the document tree.

Good luck!
