# Lab Exercise: Basic Selectors

## Objective:
Create an HTML page and apply styles using **element**, **class**, and **ID selectors**. Style elements with colors and background colors using these basic selectors, and demonstrate how to apply multiple classes to a single element.

## Instructions:
1. Create an `index.html` file.
2. Use the **element selector** to change the color of all paragraphs (`<p>`) to green.
3. Use the **class selector** to set the background color of elements with the class `highlight` to yellow.
4. Use the **ID selector** to set the color of a specific heading with the ID `main-heading` to blue.
5. Apply **two classes** (`highlight` and `text-large`) to an element. Set the background color to yellow using the `highlight` class and the text size to large using the `text-large` class.

## Example:
- Paragraphs should be green using the **element selector**.
- Elements with the class `highlight` should have a yellow background using the **class selector**.
- The element with the ID `main-heading` should have a blue color using the **ID selector**.
- An element with **two classes** (`highlight` and `text-large`) should have both a yellow background and large text.

## Expected Output:
- All paragraphs are green.
- Elements with the `highlight` class have a yellow background.
- The heading with the ID `main-heading` is blue.
- An element with both the `highlight` and `text-large` classes has a yellow background and large text.

Good luck!
