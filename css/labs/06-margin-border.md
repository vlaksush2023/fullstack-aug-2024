# Lab 6: Margin, Border, Padding, Height, Width, Auto, and Overflow

## Objective
Practice using margin, padding, borders, height, and width properties along with overflow control.

## Steps:

1. Create an HTML file lab3.html.  

2. Add a div with some text inside.  

3. Apply a margin of 20px, padding of 15px, and a border of 2px solid black.  

4. Set the width and height of the div to 300px each.  

5. Use overflow: hidden to hide any content that overflows.  


Test with `overflow: scroll` and `overflow: auto` to see the differences.


## Expected Result  
The div should have specific margins, padding, and borders applied, with content either hidden or scrollable based on the overflow setting.
