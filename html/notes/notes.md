# Introduction to Web Technology
Web technology powers websites and web applications. It includes languages, protocols, and tools used to develop websites.

## Overview of Web Technology
Web technology includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies that work together to create websites.

## Role of HTML in Web Development
HTML is the foundation of all webpages. It structures content using tags like headings, paragraphs, and lists.

# HTML Tags, Elements, Attributes
HTML uses tags to define elements. Attributes give extra information about elements (e.g., id, class).

## Understanding HTML Tags
HTML tags are like labels that define content types. They tell browsers how to display content.

## Common HTML Elements
Elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<div>` define headings, paragraphs, and containers. They organize webpage content.

## Headings
Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) organize content hierarchically. `<h1>` is the main heading, and `<h6>` is the smallest.

## Paragraphs
Paragraphs are defined by the `<p>` tag. They are used to display blocks of text on a webpage.

## Lists
Lists present items in an ordered (`<ol>`) or unordered (`<ul>`) format. They help structure content in a readable way.

## HTML Attributes and Their Usage
Attributes provide additional details about elements (e.g., src for images, href for links). They appear inside the opening tag.


# HTML Images and Tables
Images and tables help present visual content and data. Images use the `<img>` tag, and tables use `<table>`.

## Embedding Images in HTML
Images are added with the `<img>` tag. The src attribute specifies the image source, and alt provides a description.

## Image Tags
The `<img>` tag is used to insert images. Always include the alt attribute for accessibility.

## Alt Text
Alt text (alt attribute) is a description of an image. It helps screen readers and appears if the image fails to load.

## Image Sources
The src attribute defines the path to the image file. It can be a relative path or a full URL.

## Creating Tables in HTML
Tables organize data in rows and columns. The basic structure includes `<table>`, `<tr>` (rows), and `<td>` (data cells).

## Table Structure
Tables are defined by the <table> tag. Rows are created with `<tr>`, and columns are created with `<td>`.

## Table Rows and Columns
Rows (`<tr>`) hold groups of cells in a table. Columns are defined within rows using `<td>` for data and `<th>` for headers.

## Table Attributes
Table attributes like border, cellpadding, and cellspacing style the table. They control how the table looks and feels.


# HTML Links, Lists, Forms
Links, lists, and forms are crucial for interaction. Links navigate between pages, lists structure items, and forms collect user input.

## Creating Hyperlinks in HTML
Hyperlinks are created with the `<a>` tag. The href attribute defines the destination of the link.

## Anchor Tags
Anchor tags (`<a>`) create clickable links. The href attribute specifies the URL or section of the page.

## Linking to External Resources
Links can direct users to external websites by using the full URL in the href attribute.

## Internal Page Links
Anchor links navigate within the same page. Use # followed by the id of the element to jump to.

## Working with Lists
HTML supports ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists. List items are defined with the `<li>` tag.

## Ordered Lists
Ordered lists (`<ol>`) present items in a numbered sequence. Each list item is represented by `<li>`.

## Unordered Lists
Unordered lists (`<ul>`) display items with bullets. Like ordered lists, list items are marked with `<li>`.

## Nested Lists
Lists can be nested by placing one list inside another. This is helpful for creating sublists or hierarchical data.

## HTML Forms
Forms allow users to submit information. Forms use the `<form>` tag to wrap input elements like text fields and buttons.

## Form Elements
Form elements include input fields (`<input>`), dropdowns (`<select>`), and text areas (`<textarea>`). They collect user data.

## Input Types
Different input types (text, email, password, etc.) define what kind of data the user should enter.

## Form Attributes
Form attributes like action and method control form behavior. action specifies where data is sent, and method specifies how it is sent.
